<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  It was great, we spent a little time working on our own ideas, then we discussed each of our wireframes. Finally we simplified our designs down so that it is doable using only HTML elements.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  Wireframing is definitely helpful to put your thoughts and ideas out visually so you can see whether the webpage would look as you expected. It also serves as a clear guide when you are writing the html because everything is already laid out clearly for you.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  At this point, since we have no styling tool to implement, we decided the best way to design our wireframe for now is to keep it as simple as possible. We implement the neccessary elements for the blog and just built it from there.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
  I used the <section> and <footer> semantic elements in my blog.
