      <h3>JavaScript vs. Ruby - Hashes and Objects</h3>

      <p>After 4 weeks of intensive Ruby challenges, this week we are finally diving into the world of JavaScript. Programmers I speak to often have mixed feelings about JavaScript. I often hear high praises about the language, but other times, I hear people expressing clear feeling of frustration towards it. One of the very first things I learned this week was that JavaScript, unlike its name may suggest, has essentially no connection with Java. However, after a few hours of JavaScript, I actually feel there are some resemblances between JavaScript and Java, perhaps just from a purely syntactic perspective.</p>

      <p>Back to the topic of this blog post. This week I would like to discuss one of the more distinctive difference between Ruby and JavaScript: Hashes in Ruby and Objects in JavaScript. </p>
