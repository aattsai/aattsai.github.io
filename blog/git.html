      Before I started coding, I've always wondered what sets developers and recreational computer users apart. After all, almost all people today use computers excessively, not just developers. A shallow, but legimate observation is how much developers rely the Command Line to navigate around files while typical computer users rely on the graphical interface created by professional programmers.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the things many developers can navigate using Command Line is git, a extremely useful tool that allows user to keep track of the work using version control. Version control allows users to keep checkpoints along the work-in-progress and go back to any point saved in case of any future mistakes without having to start over. When a significant progress is made on the file, one can choose to make a commit to the file. Commit is the checkpoint in which the whatever content created thus far will be saved, and the progress is logged. It allows the user to go back and track its work in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
        When working on a relatively large project, sometimes developers work together to optimize the work and reduce the time required for completion. To avoid chaos created by many developers working on the same thing at the same time, version control using git is also useful to implement everyone's work together without accidentally compromising or deleting parts of the useful content. GitHub is an online platform that allows developers to upload their work so that the collaborative work can be done even when everyone isn't sitting in the same room.
