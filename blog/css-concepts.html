      <h3>CSS Concepts - Border, Margin, and Padding</h3>
      <p>Time flies, this is already the end of week three for our phase 0 portion at Dev Bootcamp. It also means I have officially moved to New York City for three weeks as of tomorrow. What an amazing three weeks it has been! After two weeks of attempting to master the basic concepts behind html and css, I would like to write up a little bit of what I've learned about basic CSS concepts.</p>

      <p>One of the more confusing concepts for beginners of CSS is the difference between Border, Margin, and Padding when one tries to implement an element onto a webpage. When I tried to understand the differences between these three properties, I found it extremely helpful to look at the image shown above as it provides a clear visualization of what each of the properties defines on a element, such as an image, on your webpage. To my understanding, border represents the line that separates the inner and the outer part of an element. The space between the border and the other foreign elements on the oter part is represented by margin. So the higher the margin is, the farther apart the element will be from other neighboring elements, or sometimes the actual border on the web browser. On the other hand, the space between the border and the content of the element, such as texts, is represented by padding. The larger the padding is, the smaller the content will appear within the element.</p>
